# Implementation plan

## Functional design

- [x] update: [change-create.feature](../../../specs/prod/softeng/change-create.feature)
  - update: Scenario Outline for issue reference - fetch to issue.md instead of embedding in change.md
  - add: Reference from Change File to Issue File in the scenario

## Construction

- [x] update: [actn-changes.md](../../../u/actn-changes.md)
  - update: Flow section - create issue.md separately when issue reference provided
  - update: Flow section - Change File follows Template 1 and references issue.md in Why section
  - update: Scenarios section - align with change-req-create.feature (separate Issue File)
