# Change request: Add Cancel option to uarchive prompt

## Why

When on a PR branch, the uarchive action prompts the Engineer with two options. There is no way to abort without choosing one of them, which may lead to unintended archiving.

## What

Add a third option to the uarchive prompt:

- Cancel (abort, no action taken)
