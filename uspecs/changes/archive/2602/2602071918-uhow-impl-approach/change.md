# Change request: uhow command for implementation approach

## Why

Engineer needs a way to get an idea about implementation approach for a Change Request. Change Technical Design (`td.md`) is no longer needed as a separate artifact - uhow can serve that purpose.

## What

Introduce uhow command:

- New uhow command that gives an idea about implementation approach for a Change Request
- Remove Change Technical Design (`td.md`) from the system - it is no longer a needed artifact
