# Change request: Maintainer creates release

## Why

Enable maintainers to create releases by tagging the current version in the main branch, establishing a formal release process for version management.

## What

Maintainer can create a release:

- Tag current version in main branch
- Publish release with tagged version

Create a devops domain architecture artifact that describes the release components briefly.
